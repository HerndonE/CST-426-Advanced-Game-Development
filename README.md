## Project 1 (CSUMB Virtual Drive Orientation)    

This game allows new students to familiarize themselves on otter territory! Choose between two gamemodes, Race and 
Free Roam. Race against the clock around the center of the CSUMB 
campus while avoiding pedestrians. Earn coins by hitting the 
checkpoints and completing laps. Hitting pedestrains will make 
you lose coins. The better you peform and the more coins you get 
will increase the penalty when hitting pedestrains. Complete three 
laps to finish the race and enjoy your visit to the CSUMB campus.
